		  A taco is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of a small hand-sized corn- or wheat-based tortilla topped with a filling. The tortilla is then folded around the filling and eaten by hand. A taco can be made with a variety of fillings, including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, beans, vegetables, and cheese, and garnished with various condiments, such as salsa, guacamole, or sour cream, and vegetables, such as lettuce, coriander, onion, tomatoes, and chiles. Tacos are a common form of antojitos, or Mexican street food, which have spread around the world.
		  
		  Tacos can be contrasted with similar foods such as burritos, which are often much larger and rolled rather than folded; taquitos, which are rolled and fried; or chalupas/tostadas, in which the tortilla is fried before filling

		An enchilada is a Mexican dish consisting of a corn tortilla rolled around a filling and covered with a savory sauce. Enchiladas can be filled with various ingredients, including meats, cheese, beans, potatoes, vegetables, or combinations.Enchiladas originated in Mexico, where the practice of rolling tortillas around other food dates back at least to Aztec times.It's a mix of meat or beans, fresh vegetables, loads of cheese, an array of sauces, and tortillas large enough to roll and fill. Toppings like guacamole, sour cream, and coriander amplify the enjoyment. If you're going to be an enchilada chef, your first ingredient would be soft tortillas.
